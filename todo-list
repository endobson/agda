remove Rational specific functions in rational proper-interval
- ℚ<
- r-
- r+
- r*
- 2r
rational intervals shouldn't have to pattern match to evaluate
- i-width
remove Rational Sign formations in rational proper-interval
Rename rational/proper-interval to rational/closed-interval
split up rational/proper-interval
add rational/raw-interval
stop using subst and use trans-=-≤
max-property should not be implicit
reduce usages of sign to order functions


---
Change Group/Ring to have non commutative versions.
Change (Comm)Monoid to include a isSetDomain requirement
Remove iso constructor from Iso
Remove gcd' constructor from GCD'
Remove gcd constructor from GCD

Change ℚ< and Posℚ to order2's version.
-- Cleanup {_}s from that
Remove bounds on operations that never need to provide them
-- ℚ->ℝ-preserves-≤

Move midℚ to a rational directory.

Make MultiplicativeStr and have semirings just be the distributative law

Add structures for ℕ≤
-- Apartness
-- Decidable
Cleanup ℕ≤
-- Remove ℕ≤ specific functions
-- same-≤
Cleanup ℤ operations so they don't conflict with generic names

Change ℝ< to have the bounds
Add ℝ⁺ constant

Change ≤ to just be a partial order
Check levels in semiring order types

Add concept of ordered ring homomorphisms
Add non-ℚ-specific utilities for diff and <
Add non-ℚ-specific utilities for minmax and multiplication (rational/minmax.agda)

FiniteMerge cleanup
finsum needs to use implicit
finproduct needs to use impliict
fcm/sigma needs to use implicit in some places

Rename:
Monoid -> MonoidStr
CommMonoid -> CommMonoidStr
isProp⊎ -> isProp-⊎

Get Better script for unused imports:
for name in `find . -name '*.agda'`; do echo $name >> unused; agda-unused $name | grep -Ev 'unused variable|instances|ring.implementations|real.heyting-field' | grep 'unused import' -B 1 >> unused; done
